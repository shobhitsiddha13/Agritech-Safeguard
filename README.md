Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, especially in underdeveloped regions with inadequate access to disease detection systems. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have transformed a multitude of fields and transformed enterprises with their wide range of capabilities. Drones offer a revolutionary way to collect high-resolution, real-time data across wide fields in agriculture. They are able to provide farmers with unmatched insights into the health of their crops, through the use of thermal pictures, multispectral data, and aerial imagery,  allowing for precise resource allocation and disease identification at an early stage.
